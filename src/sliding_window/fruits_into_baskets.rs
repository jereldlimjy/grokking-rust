/// Finds the maximum number of fruits that can be placed in the given 2 baskets.
/// - Each basket can have only one type of fruit. There is no limit to how many fruit a basket can hold.
/// - You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
/// - You will pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `fruits` - A vector of characters where each character represents a fruit tree.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// * The maximum number of fruits that can be placed in the given 2 baskets.
///
/// # Complexity
///
/// * Time Complexity: O(N)
///   * O(N) as each element in the vector is processed at most twice, once when traversing and another when shrinking the window.
/// * Space Complexity: O(1)
///   * Constant space as the hash map stores at most 2 + 1 elements.
